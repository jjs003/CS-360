SNHU CS-360 Mobile Architecture & Programming

## Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The application that I chose to develop was designed to allow users to effectively manage inventory goods. Creating this application required that several requirements were met including, the ability to register new users and log in, add new items, update existing items, delete items, and also send users text notifications when an item's quantity was reduced to 1.

## What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
In order to support user needs and to produce a user-centered UI for the app, three main screens were required. These screens included the Login Screen, the Registration Screen, and the Invetory Management Screen. From the Inventory Management Screen, users were also able to access an update item dialog and an Add New Item Screen. These designs allowed users to effectively and efficiently accomplish the goals of the application without creating unnecessary complexity. The success of these designs rested on the ability to successfully complete tasks without having to struggle with complicated and difficult to understand UI.

## How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?
The approach that I used to code this application is the approach that I take with most coding tasks. The goal is to be as incremental as possible while also testing features along the way. Only coding a small feature of an application at a time prevents the introduction of bugs that persist through to other pieces of functionality. In addition, testing previously working components after implementing new components ensures that everything works together as intended. Applying these techniques to future projects will allow me to continue to successfully complete projects with minimal frustration and maximum efficiency.

## How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?
Testing my code was done manually and each piece of functionality was tested as thoroughly as possible. Testing was done using the expected use cases as well as edge cases such as improper input and null cases. This process is important because it tests the integrity of the application and ensures that malicous users are unable to manipulate an application to garner sensitive user data. It also ensures that the user experience will not be bug ridden and will be enjoyable instead of frustrating. Testing revealed many issues along the way, but allowed me to successfully correct the issues before the application was submitted.

## Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
Innovation was a constant necessity while creating this application. This application is the first that I have created from scratch from start to finish and required me to learn a lot very quickly. Most of the process was pretty straightforward, but the final piece of functionality requiring the ability to send text notifications required a lot of research and effort to effectively implement.

## In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
Implementing the text notifications really brought the best of me out and I was really proud when I finally finished this piece of the code. There was a significant amount of complexity in creating the code for this functionality and completing this piece of the code confirmed for me that my dedication and determination is really paying off.
